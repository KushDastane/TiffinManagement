Γ£û Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
Errors validating fields in C:\Users\kushd\OneDrive\Desktop\TiffinCRM\TiffinCRM\app.json:
 Field: android - should NOT have additional property 'edgeToEdgeEnabled'.

Γ£û Check dependencies for packages that should not be installed directly
The package "expo-firebase-recaptcha" has been removed as of SDK 48. You should use the Firebase JS SDK or React Native Firebase directly. Learn more: https://expo.fyi/firebase-migration-guide
Advice:
Remove these packages from your package.json.

Γ£û Check that native modules use compatible support package versions for installed Expo SDK
Expected package @expo/config-plugins@~9.0.0
Found invalid:
  @expo/config-plugins@5.0.4
  (for more info, run: npm why @expo/config-plugins)
Advice:
Upgrade dependencies that are using the invalid package versions.

Γ£û Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
  expo-linear-gradient@15.0.8 - expected version: ~14.0.2
  react-native@0.76.3 - expected version: 0.76.9
  react-native-screens@4.1.0 - expected version: ~4.4.0
  react-native-svg@15.15.1 - expected version: 15.8.0
Your project may not work correctly until you install the expected versions of the packages.
Found outdated dependencies
Advice:
Use 'npx expo install --check' to review and upgrade your dependencies.
To ignore specific packages, add them to "expo.install.exclude" in package.json. Learn more: https://expo.fyi/dependency-validation
